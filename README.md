# WordPress base with Dotenv

Basic WordPress layout with [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv), derived from the [WordPress Skeleton](https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Skeleton).

This repo is created solely for evaluating the use of `.env` configuration with WordPress and it is by no means production proof at its current stage, so please avoid using it an environment other than development.
